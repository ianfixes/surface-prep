# [How to Prepare the Surfaces of Common Materials](http://ifreecarve.github.io/surface-prep/)

You have a material (like wood, steel, plastic, etc), with something on it (rust, paint, grease, stickers, ants, etc).  You want it to have something different on it (paint, chrome, wax, grease, spiders, etc).  What do you apply to your material, and in what order?

As of May 2016, the Internet was not very helpful on this topic -- either it worked backwards (e.g. "103949 uses for vinegar!"), or was very loose on the differences between mineral spirits and paint thinner, types of alchol, etc.

My solution to that is this repository, specifically the infographics in `gh-pages`:

## How to Read These

All the diagrams assume some base material (steel, wood, plastic, etc).  The dots in the diagram are substances that might be found on this surface (like water, oil, etc).  Each of the arrows lists a chemical or process that can be applied to the material, and shows what you will end up when if you apply that chemical.  For example, start with a plastic surface that has soap on it.  You apply water.  Now you have a surface that has water on it.  You apply time.  Now you have a bare plastic surface.

```
 ___      water      _____      time      ____________
|soap| -----------> |water| -----------> |bare plastic|
 ----                -----                ------------
```


## How to Contribute

I'm a novice at [d3](https://d3js.org/).
I don't have a very good knowledge of the best practices for which chemicals to apply (and when) in woodworking, metalworking, nor for any of the wide range of plastics.
I am happy for all the help I can get.

* Send me an email with material/chemical suggestions at ifreecarve@gmail.com, (and be prepared to cite sources).
* Fork this repository and add lines to the relevant CSV files.  It's the `gh-pages` branch.
* Mention this page to a friend who does a lot of work in their garage or shop.
